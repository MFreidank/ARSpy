This package provides a pure python/numpy 
implementation of adaptive rejection sampling as 
proposed by P. Wild, W.R. Gilks in 
*Algorithm AS 287: Adaptive Rejection Sampling from Log Concave Density 
functions*.

Under the (frequently satisfied) assumption that the target distribution to 
sample from has a log-concave density function, this algorithm allows us 
to sample without calculating any integrals. 

This sampling method is *exact* (all resulting samples are i.i.d) and 
*efficient* and our implementation can handle any univariate log-concave 
distribution. 

One prime use case is Gibbs sampling, where one frequently encounters many 
1D log-concave distributions.
